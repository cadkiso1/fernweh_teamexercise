I woke up and ate a yummy bratwurst. It went well with my toasted brot.

I had a bit of the meat sweats, so I sat in front of the Klimaanlage to cool myself off.
I got thirsty so I went to the Biergarten for a beverage. I traveled in my BMW on the autobahn from Berlin to Raesfeld. Then I traveled down the hauptstrasse until I got to my destination. My hund came with me on the trip. 
Which was unfortunate because he ate my leftover bratwurst and brot.
