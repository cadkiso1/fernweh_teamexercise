I woke up and ate a yummy bratwurst. It went well with my toasted brot.

I had a bit of the meat sweats, so I sat in front of the Klimaanlage to cool myself off.
I got thirsty so I went to the Biergarten for a beverage. I traveled in my BMW on the autobahn from Berlin to Raesfeld. Then I traveled down the hauptstrasse until I got to my destination. My hund came with me on the trip. 
Which was unfortunate because he ate my leftover bratwurst and brot.
Luckily for me there was a beirgarten nearby where I could refill on bratwurst and Weihenstephaner.
The car beside me on the way there challenged me to a race, which I accepted because my wettbewerbsfaehig tendencies. 
The race was so grueling and intense, i almost had an accident in my Lederhose!
I’m sick of following my dreams, man. I’m just going to ask where they’re going and hook up with ’em later
Hopefully, those dreams will lead me to a new car, maybe a Porsche?
But while I wait for that dream to come true, I'll just stuff my face with some Gabaeck.
Oh, who am I kidding, I'm going to stuff my face with Apfelkuchen!
And maybe a little more brot... :) 
Really, I'm going to spend 50 euros at the Baeckerei!
